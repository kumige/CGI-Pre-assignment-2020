### Build instructions

##### Requirements
- Android Studio
- USB cable
- Android device with Android 7.0 (Nougat) or higher

#### My solution
Observations are saved locally in a Room database. The dynamic list is a RecyclerView with LiveData coming from the database. The user is able to add photos to observations from the phones external storage. 

#### My experience
I have had experience with Android apps from multiple school projects, so I didn't have much problems working on it. I have previously used the Anko libraries to interact with a Room database, but while working on this task, I noticed the library was deprecated December 2019. I learned to use Kotlin coroutines instead.
